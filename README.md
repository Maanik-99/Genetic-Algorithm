# Genetic Algorithm for Target Sum Problem

## Description
This project implements a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to find a list of `k` numbers (0–9) where the sum of the first two numbers equals a target `T`.

## Features
- **Population Initialization**: Randomly generates individuals.
- **Fitness Calculation**: Measures how close the sum is to `T`.
- **Tournament Selection**: Selects parents based on fitness.
- **Single-Point Crossover**: Combines parents to produce offspring.
- **Mutation**: Introduces randomness to maintain diversity.
- **Termination**: Stops when a solution is found or after `max_generations`.


  
## Run the script
- **python Genetic_Algorithm.py**

## Outputs
- **Input: T=7, k=3 → Output: 4 3 0**
- **Input: T=10, k=3 → Output: 8 2 0**
